Initially, I tried to use Docker but some problem occured when I tried to call python main_logic.py file from php code.

How to run the project?
Steps:
  1. Download the translator-app folder
  2. In terminal go to src folder
  3. Run: php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
  4. In website run: localhost:8000
  5. Press the "Load Patients' Data" button
  6. Select your required patient's information
