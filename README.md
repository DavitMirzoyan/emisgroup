# emisgroup

Initially, I tried to use Docker but some problem occured when I tried to call python main_logic.py file from php code.

How to run the project? 
    Steps:
      1. Go to the master branch instead of main
      2. Download the emis folder
      3. In terminal go to src folder
      4. Run: php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
      5. In website run: localhost:8000
      6. Press the "Load Patients' Data" button
      7. Select your required patient's information
